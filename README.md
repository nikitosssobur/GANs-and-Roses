# :gun: :gun: :gun: GANs-and-Roses :rose: :rose: :rose:
This repository is created for my implementations and experiments of GANs models and its variants   


## Repository structure description
All model classes are in the file "gan_models.py". 

At this time this file contains the following models:

Discriminator and Generator classes for 3DGAN model from this paper [1](#ref1).

Encoder, Discriminator and Generator classes for AgeCGAN model from [2](#ref2).
